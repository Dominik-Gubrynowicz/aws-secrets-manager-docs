AWS Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in AWS and helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices\.

Security Hub collects security data from across AWS accounts, services, and supported third\-party partner products and helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security issues\. 

The AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard is a set of controls that detects when your deployed accounts and resources deviate from security best practices\. Security Hub provides a set of controls for Secrets Manager that allows you to continuously evaluate and identify areas of deviation from best practices\.
